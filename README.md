First program hello world

Hello All!

This is my first program, it is all very confusing and I feel like I am always in the wrong place but I am figuring it out.
I like to hoist weights and train. In my time off I play ice hockey but what I enjoy most is spending time with my wife watching
our daughter and family grow.
